## SELECT

Reading objects from the database

**Syntax**

```text  
<SELECT statement> ::=
    [ WITH { [ XMLNAMESPACES ,] [ <common_table_expression> [,...n] ] } ]  
    <query_expression>
    [ ORDER BY { order_by_expression | column_position [ ASC | DESC ] }
  [ ,...n ] ]
    [ <FOR Clause>]
    [ OPTION ( <query_hint> [ ,...n ] ) ]
<query_expression> ::=
    { <query_specification> | ( <query_expression> ) }
    [  { UNION [ ALL ] | EXCEPT | INTERSECT }  
        <query_specification> | ( <query_expression> ) [...n ] ]
<query_specification> ::=
SELECT [ ALL | DISTINCT ]
    [TOP ( expression ) [PERCENT] [ WITH TIES ] ]
    < select_list >
    [ INTO new_table ]
    [ FROM { <table_source> } [ ,...n ] ]
    [ WHERE <search_condition> ]
    [ <GROUP BY> ]
    [ HAVING < search_condition > ]  
```

**Example**

```sql
SELECT *  
FROM DimEmployee  
ORDER BY LastName;
```

### SELECT INTO

Inserting records into the database which are derived from other data

**Syntax**

```doc
[ INTO new_table ]
[ ON filegroup ]
```

**Example**

```sql
SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, e.JobTitle, a.AddressLine1, a.City,
    sp.Name AS [State/Province], a.PostalCode  
INTO dbo.EmployeeAddresses  
FROM Person.Person AS c  
    JOIN HumanResources.Employee AS e
    ON e.BusinessEntityID = c.BusinessEntityID  
    JOIN Person.BusinessEntityAddress AS bea  
    ON e.BusinessEntityID = bea.BusinessEntityID  
    JOIN Person.Address AS a  
    ON bea.AddressID = a.AddressID  
    JOIN Person.StateProvince as sp
    ON sp.StateProvinceID = a.StateProvinceID;  
GO
```

### SELECT OVER

Reads objects from the database, after defining a window or subset of record to query

**Syntax**

```sql
-- Syntax for SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, and Azure SQL Data Warehouse  
  
OVER (
       [ <PARTITION BY clause> ]  
       [ <ORDER BY clause> ]
       [ <ROW or RANGE clause> ]  
      )  
  
<PARTITION BY clause> ::=  
PARTITION BY value_expression , ... [ n ]  
  
<ORDER BY clause> ::=  
ORDER BY order_by_expression  
    [ COLLATE collation_name ]
    [ ASC | DESC ]
    [ ,...n ]  
  
<ROW or RANGE clause> ::=  
{ ROWS | RANGE } <window frame extent>  
  
<window frame extent> ::=
{   <window frame preceding>  
  | <window frame between>  
}  
<window frame between> ::=
  BETWEEN <window frame bound> AND <window frame bound>  
  
<window frame bound> ::=
{   <window frame preceding>  
  | <window frame following>  
}  
  
<window frame preceding> ::=
{  
    UNBOUNDED PRECEDING  
  | <unsigned_value_specification> PRECEDING  
  | CURRENT ROW  
}  
  
<window frame following> ::=
{  
    UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING  
  | <unsigned_value_specification> FOLLOWING  
  | CURRENT ROW  
}  
  
<unsigned value specification> ::=
{  <unsigned integer literal> }  
```

GO  
SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY PostalCode ORDER BY SalesYTD DESC) AS "Row Number",
    p.LastName, s.SalesYTD, a.PostalCode

    ```

# Database Elements

## Scripts

A script is a list of instructions which instruct an interpreter what operations to perform.  The T-SQL (Transact-SQL) script notation describes how to interact with a database.

These scripts, which are called queries support the basic fundamental operations required in a typical data persistence scenario.

- Store Data
- Retrieve Data
- Modify Data
- Remove Data
- Protect Data
- Compress Data
- Convert Data
- Filter Data

## Databases

A Database is a collection of entities and behaviors which can be used to represent information.

SQL Server is a Relational Database, meaning that the information stored in it, is comprised of records which are related to one another.

There are also Non-Relational database concepts which recently are becoming popular, which store records as documents.  Non-relational database concepts can be used within SQL Server, but there are dedicated Non-Relational databases such as MongoDB, which typically require document related syntax which is not covered in this article.  

## Table

Data is stored in tables.  In fact the system tables are used to store the definitions of entities, such as databases, tables, stored procedures, functions and view as well as other database entities within a database server.

Tables have data pages, which each have a specific type and contain parts of the table.

| Page type                                           | Contents                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data                                                | Data rows with all data, except text, ntext, image, nvarchar(max), varchar(max), varbinary(max), and xml data, when text in row is set to ON.                                                                        |
| Index                                               | Index entries.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Text/Image                                          | Large object data types: (text, ntext, image, nvarchar(max), varchar(max), varbinary(max), and xml data) <br>Variable length columns when the data row exceeds 8 KB: (varchar, nvarchar, varbinary, and sql_variant) |
| Global Allocation Map, Shared Global Allocation Map | Information about whether extents are allocated.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Page Free Space (PFS)                               | Information about page allocation and free space available on pages.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Index Allocation Map                                | Information about extents used by a table or index per allocation unit.                                                                                                                                              |
| Bulk Changed Map                                    | Information about extents modified by bulk operations since the last BACKUP LOG statement per allocation unit.                                                                                                       |
| Differential Changed Map                            | Information about extents that have changed since the last BACKUP DATABASE statement per allocation unit.                                                                                                            |

![Data Page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/media/page-architecture.gif?view=sql-server-ver15)

## Column

Tables have Table Columns, or just Columns, as they are typically called.  A Column definition must have at least a name and a data type.  Columns may also contain other information including metadata, statistics, security, compression and hints.

In addition Tables will normally have a Primary Key defined, which is made up of one or more Table Columns, and helps access records by a chosen identifier.

## Index

Indexes are defined on Tables and are used to accelerate the database query performance by assisting operations which read and join data.

There are two types of Indexes

- [Clustered Indexes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/sql-server-index-design-guide?view=sql-server-ver15#Clustered)
  - A clustered index enforces a sequence which the records are physically stored on the disk
  - Data is therefore sorted by default
- [Non-Clustered Indexes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/sql-server-index-design-guide?view=sql-server-ver15#Nonclustered)
  - A non-clustered index records the order of specified columns within the collection of data pages which make up a table
  - A record order is not enforced by a non-clustered index, so data is not sorted by default

<div class="alert alert-info"><b>Comparing Clustered Indexes vs. Non-Clustered Indexes</b><br>Clustered Indexes are faster to read but slower to modify<br>Non-Clustered Indexes are faster to update but slower to read</div>

![Clustered Index](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/media/bokind2.gif?view=sql-server-ver15)

Indexes may have additional constraints

- [Unique Indexes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/sql-server-index-design-guide?view=sql-server-ver15#Unique)
  - All record keys must be unique, per permutation
  - Unique index constraints are typically used to ensure data integrity
- [Filtered Indexes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/sql-server-index-design-guide?view=sql-server-ver15#Filtered)
  - Return a well define subset of records from a large table
  
  ```sql
  CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX FIBillOfMaterialsWithEndDate  
    ON Production.BillOfMaterials (ComponentID, StartDate)  
    WHERE EndDate IS NOT NULL ;  
    GO  
  ```

- [Columnstore Indexes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/sql-server-index-design-guide?view=sql-server-ver15#columnstore_index)
  - A columnstore index is a technology for storing, retrieving and managing data by using a columnar data format, called a columnstore
  - Typically SQL Server table indexes are Row Store, or records which are stored row by row.  Conversely, a Columnstore index physically stores records column by column
  - By storing records in a column store, compression is improved
- [Hash Indexes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/sql-server-index-design-guide?view=sql-server-ver15#hash_index)
  - Support memory optimized tables
  - A hash index consists of an array of pointers, and each element of the array is called a hash bucket.
  - Buckets contain entries which store a list of key entries
  - Entries are a value of an index key
  - A Hash function is used to determine which bucket a record belongs in
- [Memory-Optimized Non-Clustered Indexes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/sql-server-index-design-guide?view=sql-server-ver15#inmem_nonclustered_index)
  
## View

Views are a projection of the data in tables, and as such do not themselves contain data.
Views are used to perform create, read, update and delete operations on some combination of tables which together project the data types from one or more tables.  They are therefore a powerful way of inspecting and manipulating data in context specific ways.

## Cursors

Cursors are an extension of the original T-SQL script concepts to permit the record by record processing of a data set.  Cursors are typically slow, and therefore set operations are generally preferred over Cursor updates.

## Joins

There are several different types of joins which are supported via T-SQL

In the following join scenarios, these example tables will be included

**Pet table**

| PetId | OwnerId | PetName    |
| ----- | ------- | ---------- |
| 1     | A       | Mr Tinkles |
| 2     | A       | Spot       |
| 3     | B       | Rover      |
| 4     | C       | Rover      |

**Owner table**

| OwnerId | OwnerName |
| ------- | --------- |
| A       | Bill      |
| B       | Jane      |
| C       | Fred      |
| D       | Sam       |

### INNER JOIN

An INNER JOIN type ensures that only records which meet the join condition will be returned.

Inner Joining Pet table with Owner table on OwnerId

| Pet.PetId | Pet.OwnerId | Pet.PetName | Owner.OwnerID | Owner.OwnerName |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| 1         | A           | Mr Tinkles  | A             | Bill            |
| 2         | A           | Spot        | A             | Bill            |
| 3         | B           | Rover       | B             | Jane            |
| 4         | C           | Rover       | C             | Fred            |

![Inner Join](https://www.dofactory.com/Images/sql-inner-join.png)

Notes:

- Owner Sam (D) is not included in the results

### OUTER JOIN or FULL OUTER JOIN or FULL JOIN

Outer Joining Pet table with Owner table on OwnerId

| Pet.PetId | Pet.OwnerId | Pet.PetName | Owner.OwnerID | Owner.OwnerName |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| 1         | A           | Mr Tinkles  | A             | Bill            |
| 2         | A           | Spot        | A             | Bill            |
| 3         | B           | Rover       | B             | Jane            |
| 4         | C           | Rover       | C             | Fred            |
| -         | -           | -           | D             | Sam             |

![Full Join](https://www.dofactory.com/Images/sql-full-join.png)

### LEFT OUTER JOIN or LEFT JOIN

Left Outer Joining Pet table with Owner table on OwnerId

| Pet.PetId | Pet.OwnerId | Pet.PetName | Owner.OwnerID | Owner.OwnerName |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| 1         | A           | Mr Tinkles  | A             | Bill            |
| 2         | A           | Spot        | A             | Bill            |
| 3         | B           | Rover       | B             | Jane            |
| 4         | C           | Rover       | C             | Fred            |

Notes:  

- Pets is the left table
- Owners is the right table
- Owner Sam (D) is not found in the result set, because there are no Pets owned by Sam.

![Left Join](https://www.dofactory.com/Images/sql-left-join.png)

### RIGHT OUTER JOIN or RIGHT JOIN

Right Outer Joining Pet table with Owner table on OwnerId

| Pet.PetId | Pet.OwnerId | Pet.PetName | Owner.OwnerID | Owner.OwnerName |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| 1         | A           | Mr Tinkles  | A             | Bill            |
| 2         | A           | Spot        | A             | Bill            |
| 3         | B           | Rover       | B             | Jane            |
| 4         | C           | Rover       | C             | Fred            |
| -         | -           | -           | D             | Sam             |

Notes:  

- Pets is the left table.
- Owners is the right table
- Owner Sam (D) is found in the result set, because Sam is on the table on the right.

![Right Join](https://www.dofactory.com/Images/sql-right-join.png)

### [Nested Loop Joins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/performance/joins?view=sql-server-ver15#nested_loops)

If one join input is small (fewer than 10 rows) and the other join input is fairly large and indexed on its join columns, an index nested loops join is the fastest join operation because they require the least I/O and the fewest comparisons.

The nested loops join, also called nested iteration, uses one join input as the outer input table (shown as the top input in the graphical execution plan) and one as the inner (bottom) input table. The outer loop consumes the outer input table row by row. The inner loop, executed for each outer row, searches for matching rows in the inner input table.

### [Merge Joins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/performance/joins?view=sql-server-ver15#merge)

If the two join inputs are not small but are sorted on their join column (for example, if they were obtained by scanning sorted indexes), a merge join is the fastest join operation. If both join inputs are large and the two inputs are of similar sizes, a merge join with prior sorting and a hash join offer similar performance. However, hash join operations are often much faster if the two input sizes differ significantly from each other.

The merge join requires both inputs to be sorted on the merge columns, which are defined by the equality (ON) clauses of the join predicate. The query optimizer typically scans an index, if one exists on the proper set of columns, or it places a sort operator below the merge join. In rare cases, there may be multiple equality clauses, but the merge columns are taken from only some of the available equality clauses.

### [Hash Join](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/performance/joins?view=sql-server-ver15#hash)

Hash joins can efficiently process large, unsorted, nonindexed inputs. They are useful for intermediate results in complex queries because:

- Intermediate results are not indexed (unless explicitly saved to disk and then indexed) and often are not suitably sorted for the next operation in the query plan.
- Query optimizers estimate only intermediate result sizes. Because estimates can be very inaccurate for complex queries, algorithms to process intermediate results not only must be efficient, but also must degrade gracefully if an intermediate result turns out to be much larger than anticipated.

### [Adaptive Joins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/performance/joins?view=sql-server-ver15#adaptive)

Batch mode Adaptive Joins enable the choice of a Hash Join or Nested Loops join method to be deferred until after the first input has been scanned. The Adaptive Join operator defines a threshold that is used to decide when to switch to a Nested Loops plan. A query plan can therefore dynamically switch to a better join strategy during execution without having to be recompiled.

## [WHERE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/where-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) filters

Specifies the search condition for the rows returned by the query.

WHERE conditions are applicable to all CRUD operations (SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT (FROM))

```sql
-- Uses AdventureWorksDW  
  
SELECT EmployeeKey, LastName  
FROM DimEmployee  
WHERE LastName = 'Smith' ;
```

or partial match (contains)

```sql
-- Uses AdventureWorksDW  
  
SELECT EmployeeKey, LastName  
FROM DimEmployee  
WHERE LastName LIKE ('%Smi%');  
```

or multi-condition where statements

```sql
-- Uses AdventureWorksDW  
  
SELECT EmployeeKey, LastName  
FROM DimEmployee  
WHERE EmployeeKey = 1 OR EmployeeKey = 8 OR EmployeeKey = 12;  
```

or in a set

```sql
-- Uses AdventureWorksDW  
  
SELECT EmployeeKey, LastName  
FROM DimEmployee  
WHERE LastName IN ('Smith', 'Godfrey', 'Johnson');  
```

or a value in a range

```sql
-- Uses AdventureWorksDW  
  
SELECT EmployeeKey, LastName  
FROM DimEmployee  
WHERE EmployeeKey Between 100 AND 200;  
```

### WHERE ANY

```sql
    SELECT ProductName
      FROM Product
     WHERE Id = ANY
           (SELECT ProductId
              FROM OrderItem
             WHERE Quantity = 1)
```

### WHERE ALL

```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT FirstName + ' ' + LastName as CustomerName
      FROM Customer, [Order]
     WHERE Customer.Id = [Order].CustomerId
       AND TotalAmount > ALL 
           (SELECT AVG(TotalAmount)
              FROM [Order]
             GROUP BY CustomerId)
```

## Sub-Queries

A subquery is a query that is nested inside a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement, or inside another subquery. A subquery can be used anywhere an expression is allowed. In this example a subquery is used as a column expression named MaxUnitPrice in a SELECT statement.

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2016;
GO
SELECT Ord.SalesOrderID, Ord.OrderDate,
    (SELECT MAX(OrdDet.UnitPrice)
     FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail AS OrdDet
     WHERE Ord.SalesOrderID = OrdDet.SalesOrderID) AS MaxUnitPrice
FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader AS Ord;
GO
```
