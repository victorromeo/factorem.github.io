GOAP is a state based approach to automated planning and decision making, which delivers highly flexible and performant results

## [STRIPS](https://alumni.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/gdc2006_orkin_jeff_fear.pdf)

Strips is an acronym for STandford Research Institute Problem Solver.

## [GOAP](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/goap.html) (Original)

GOAP is an implementation of STRIPS algorithm created specifically for the first person shooter game [FEAR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F.E.A.R.)

GOAP requires that NPCs in the game be described with 
- Actions - Things that NPCs can do
  - Preconditions - State conditions required before an action can be undertaken
  - Costs - The cost of performing an action
  - Effects - The end result to the environment, if the action occurs
- Goals
  - Finishing conditions for a character's plans

### A* Algorithm 

The heart of the GOAP implementation is the A* (A star) algorithm which finds the path of least cost, in a highly performant heuristic search.  Path of least cost is distinct to shortest path as the resulting path is based on a graph traversal with edge costs.
