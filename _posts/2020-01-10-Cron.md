Cron is the default scheduler in linux distributions.  Here's a couple of easy helpers

## Background

| Command                  | Description                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `crontab -e`             | Open the Cron for the current user   |
| `crontab -l`             | List Cron tasks for the current user |
| `crontab -u username -l` | View the Cron tasks of another user  |

Cron tasks are added by adding rows at the bottom of the crontab file using the following syntax

`1 2 3 4 5 /path/to/command arg1 arg2`

or

`1 2 3 4 5 /path/to/script.sh`

Where,

1. Minute (0-59)
2. Hours (0-23)
3. Day (0-31)
4. Month (0-12 [12 == December])
5. Day of the week(0-7 [7 or 0 == sunday])
/path/to/command â€“ Script or command name to schedule

```txt
* * * * * command to be executed
- - - - -
| | | | |
| | | | ----- Day of week (0 - 7) (Sunday=0 or 7)
| | | ------- Month (1 - 12)
| | --------- Day of month (1 - 31)
| ----------- Hour (0 - 23)
------------- Minute (0 - 59)
```

Each value can be made using 
Syntax | Description
----|----
`*`	| any value
`,`	| value list separator
`-`	| range of values
`/`	| step values
`whitespace` | value separator


## Examples

There are some alias helpers which are not universally supported

| Syntax      | Description   |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| `@yearly`   | Yearly tasks  |
| `@annually` | Annual tasks  |
| `@monthly`  | Monthly tasks |
| `@weekly`   | Weekly tasks  |
| `@daily`    | Daily tasks   |
| `@hourly`   | Hourly tasks  |
| `@reboot`   | Upon reboot   |

## Cron location

| Path                | Description                         | Notes|
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |---|
| `/etc/cron.d`       | Ad-hoc cron file can be placed here | |
| `/etc/crontab`      | System level cron tasks             | |
| `/etc/cron.hourly`  | Hourly cron tasks                   |Must be root owner|
| `/etc/cron.daily`   | Daily cron tasks                    |Must be root owner|
| `/etc/cron.weekly`  | Weekly cron tasks                   |Must be root owner|
| `/etc/cron.monthly` | Monthly cron tasks                  |Must be root owner|

## Troubleshooting

1. Checking Start

    When a Cron task starts it is logged in the `syslog` found at `/var/log/syslog` also accessible using `dmesg` for recent events only.

    A cron task executing a script such as `0 * * * * /path/to/script.sh` will appear in the log as `script.sh`, and as a result you can find the task executing using grep.

    `grep <pattern> /var/log/syslog` which should list every time the pattern is matched in the syslog, and therefore listing every time cron started the task.

    i.e. `grep my_script.sh /var/log/syslog`

2. Checking simultaneous execution

    `ps aux | grep <pattern>` can be used to show all current processes which match a pattern. 

    i.e. `ps aux | grep my_script.sh`

    Sometimes it is worth adding this check into the Cron script to determine whether to bail out preventing multiple copies of a script to execute in parallel

    Example: `*/2 * * * * /path/to/myscript.sh`

    ```txt
    #!/bin/sh
    if ps -ef | grep -v grep | grep doctype.php ; then
            exit 0
    else
            /home/user/bin/doctype.php >> /home/user/bin/spooler.log &
            #mailing program
            /home/user/bin/simplemail.php "Print spooler was not running...  Restarted."
            exit 0
    fi
    ```

    Another alternative to prevent multiple execution can be achieved via `flock`

    i.e. `* * * * * /usr/bin/flock -n /tmp/fcj.lockfile /usr/local/bin/frequent_cron_job`

3. Logging Errors

    `42 1 * * * /path/to/real/job || echo $?` will write an error code to the `syslog`, if the first script fails

    `/var/log/auth.log` records when authentication occurs, and can therefore be used to determine when processes such as the cron script starts and stops.

    A script which doesn't report a consistent error already, can be corrected 

    - Add `set -e -u` to top of the script file, under the `#!` line
    - Then change the cron task script to `sh -x main_script.sh || echo Cron task failed: $?` and note `-x` causes each line to be printed out before it is executed
    - Then grep the syslog to find the task `grep 'Cron' /var/log/syslog`
