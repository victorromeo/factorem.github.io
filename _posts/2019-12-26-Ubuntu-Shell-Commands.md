The Ubuntu operating system is a popular operating system, however often accessing a gui is either not appropriate or simple not available.  These command line operations help the administration and use of an Ubuntu host.

## File systems

Ubuntu can use a range of different file systems, however here are the most typical

* Extended File System [EXT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_file_system)
  * EXT4 is the standard for Ubuntu
  * Windows cannot access these file systems without additional functionality  
* File Allocation Table [FAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table)
  * Useful to transfer files between Windows and *nix systems like Ubuntu as both operating systems support the standard implementation

## Concepts and Glossary

Term | Meaning
----|-----
*Symbolic Link* |- can cross the file system,<br>- allows you to link between directories, <br>- has different inode number and file permissions than original file, <br>- permissions will not be updated, <br>- has only the path of the original file, not the contents.
*Hard link*|-can’t cross the file system boundaries (i.e. A hardlink can only work on the same filesystem),<br>- can’t link directories,<br>- has the same inode number and permissions of original file,<br>- permissions will be updated if we change the permissions of source file,<br>- has the actual contents of original file, so that you still can view the contents, even if the original file moved or removed

Shells such as bash, csh, ksh and dash are implementations of the POSIX standard.  [POSIX Standard](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/xcu_chap02.html)

The implementation used by default on a system is determined by either a symbolic link or hard link on the file */bin/sh* which points to a POSIX implementation.

## Snippets

### Reverse SSH Tunnel

To enable a persistent SSH Reverse Tunnel, use **autossh** rather than ssh as it will attempt to reestablish the tunnel open, if the connection is lost.

*Prerequisite:* `sudo apt install autossh`

1. Create and add the following to `/etc/systemd/system/autossh.service`
  *Note: the argument flags `-t -t` ensures the SSH pseudo terminal is not rejected*

    ```bash
    [Unit]
    Description=Auto Reverse SSH
    Requires=systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
    After=systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
    [Service]
    ExecStart=/path/to/autossh -i /path/to/key.pem -R <port>:localhost:22 ubuntu@<remote.fqdn.host> -t -t
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

2. Enable using `sudo systemctl enable autossh.service` to ensure it starts on the next boot

3. Start the service immediately, rather than wait for the next boot using `sudo systemctl start autossh.service`
  *Note: the `.service` is not mandatory here and can be dropped but rather used to demonstrate what is really being done by systemctl*

4. Check the status using `systemctl status autossh` to ensure that the service has correctly established the connection.  Look for a line beginning with `Active: active (running)` to indicate succes. If a failure has occurred, the easiest way to find it is using the command `journalctl | grep autossh`.
