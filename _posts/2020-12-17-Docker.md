Docker is a convenient technology to create portable isolated and reproducible runtime environments for design-time development and production hosting of applications

## Main technology concepts

Docker is an abstraction technology which isolates an applications runtime environment from host infrastructure, and thereby increases the applications portability by encouraging applications which run upon a Docker Engine, on any host.

This increases uniformity, aids reproduction, decreases host specific configuration needs and aids development in isolation.

Docker hosts are different to virtual machine hosts
- Docker abstracts the application layer, combining application code and application dependencies into an image. Docker sits above the OS and therefore a host has only one OS to maintain, even when hosting multiple concurrent Docker Containers.
- VMs abstract physical hardware, resulting in systems which act as independent hosts. Multiple VMs result in multiple OS instances, including licencing costs, maintenance of multiple OS kernels and therefore multiply patching obligations

### Image

- An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container.

### Container

- Running instance of an image, with optional communication and technologies to interact with the host environment and other containers
- Changes to a container occur as a delta, above the original Docker container image

### Docker Engine

- Long running server acting as a daemon
- Serves a REST API for managing containers and images and other dependencies
- Serves a CLI (Command Line Interface) client `docker`

![Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/images/engine-components-flow.png)

### Docker Architecture

Docker containers communicate with the Docker daemon which acts upon the host OS and infrastructure, to maintain the lifecycle and provide application communication needs

![Architecture](https://docs.docker.com/engine/images/architecture.svg)

### [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
- Stores a secure collection of container images for public and private use

### [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/create-swarm/)

Docker Swarms enable applications to be quickly scaled over docker hosts which have swarm capabilities enabled.

Swarms can be considered a mechanism for getting multiple instances of an application to run concurrently.

Docker Swarm manages host networking, load balancing, service discovery, scaling on behalf of the application administrator.

#### [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

Kubernetes is a Google technology which automates deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications.  You can use Kubernetes to manage Docker container application lifecycles instead of Docker Swarm, however they are separate technologies,are independent of each other and require different deployment concepts.

## [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)

A Dockerfile is a recipe for building a container image

```docker
FROM python:3.7-alpine
WORKDIR /code
ENV FLASK_APP=app.py
ENV FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0
RUN apk add --no-cache gcc musl-dev linux-headers
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 5000
COPY . .
CMD ["flask", "run"]
```

## [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/)

A `docker-compose.yml` file describes how to deploy containers and the associated dependencies

```yml
version: "3.9"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
```

Start with a simple command line operation

```bash
docker-compose up
```
Detached mode startup

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

When using detached mode startup, the docker composition can be stopped without removing the container or dependencies

```bash
docker-compose stop
```

Stop just as easily, removing all the containers and dependencies in one step

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### [Overview](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

## [Docker CLI](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/)

Run an instance of the ubuntu docker image, and create an interactive session to a bash shell

```bash
docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash
```
