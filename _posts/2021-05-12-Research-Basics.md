A basic outline of the basic concepts of research

## Research Methods

Research Methods are the various processes, schemes, procedures and algorithms used in research.  Research methods used for scientific study seek to provide explanations for a natural phenomena within the scope of a scientific domain, based upon observations, measurements and facts, rather than by reasoning alone.  

## Research Methodology

Research Methodologies are a systematic way to solve a problem.  A Research Methodology is chosen to describe, explain and predict, and is typically designed for a specific scenario under investigation.  

When selecting and designing a Research Methodology a researcher must select Research Methods which:
- are suitable
- provide the necessary data and order of accuracy required by the study
- is suitably efficient, cost effective, achievable, timely, and relevant

## Types of Research

### Fundamental or basic research

Also called theoretical research, basic research is the general undertaking of research for investigation sake, and not specifically to solve a particular problem.

Typically:
- avoids specificity, but instead seeks to describe general solutions
- describes basic processes used
- describe why things happen
- uses technical language

### Applied research

Applied research is the use of scientific research methodologies and research methods to solve specific problems under investigation, and produce tangible usable outcomes.

Typically: 
- no attempt is made to generalize applied research outcomes into general solutions
- finds the variables to solve the problem once
- describes how an effect is produced
- used to find problems
- communicates the outcome in easy to understand non-technical language

## Experimental Outcomes

While an experiment is being designed, the researcher needs to consider what needs to be achieved, and what evidence is required to support conclusions.

- What data will provide suitable evidence to proceed to further experimentation or commercialization
- 

### Quantitative Outcomes

Quantitative outcomes:
- Are a set of numerical, non-descriptive results
- Can be charted, graphed, tabled, etc
- Describe *What, Where, When*

### Qualitative Outcomes

Qualitative outcomes:
- are non-numerical, descriptive results
- explores data to describe the meaning of a scenario
- Describes *Why, How*

## How research is undertaken

- General selection of research topic
- Investigation and definition of research topic
- Reading of relevant literature and gathering of reference collection
- Basic evaluation and assessment of the outstanding items unsolved by current research 
- Creation of hypothesis for unsolved problems
- Research design to select Research Methodology and Research Methods required to prove or disprove a hypothesis
- Actual investigation is undertaken, collecting outcomes
- Data is analysed
- Conclusions are drawn from the data analysis
- Reporting documents the research methods, research methodologies, outcomes, analysis and conclusions

## Research Hypothesis

Research following a scientific process always aims towards a goal.  The goal is designed to answer a question, solve a problem or seek greater understanding about a natural system under investigation.  Research is methodical, and by necessity,rigorous in its approach, so that the goal has the best chance of success. Research is conducted in a series logical steps to explain how the result was achieved, so that it can be repeated as required. 

Research goals are chosen by the researcher to answer to questions of interest.

Once a question is identified which is to be studied, one or more experiments are designed to provide the answer.

Before each experiment is conducted, a hypothesis is formed, about the likely outcome.  

The researcher must then review the hypothesis to determine whether it provides answers which contribute toward the goal.  If objectives are not likely to be achieved, then the experiment would be a waste of time, and a alternate experiment should be conducted instead which does support the goal.

A hypothesis is:
- A description of what is expected
- Always a reasonable scientific prediction
- Typically based upon and reliant of earlier study
- Typically stated as a series of *if-then* statements
- Typically used to define variable needed for study, based from intelligent guesses or inspiration

A hypothesis is always required before starting to produce results, as the goal of the results must be answering a need to be meaningful.

Examples of hypothesis:

- *If* pure water is boiled at sea level, *then* the water will be observed to boil, producing bubbles and steam at 100 degrees celsius
- *If* an unsupported object is released near the ground, *then* it will move in the direction toward the centre of gravity of the earth

These are guesses, based upon observation and previous experiments.

The hypothesis will either be **validated** or **invalidated**, and further study can be conducted if necessary to deduce the cause.

## Results

All experiments are meaningless unless the outcomes are recorded.  

### How to store results

The most appropriate way to record the information is determined by the researcher before the experiment is conducted.  Data may be collected, in several ways, as:
- Spreadsheets or tables
- Descriptions of observations
- Drawings or photographs, screen captures of observations
- Digital files or paper format

### Where results are to be stored

Results should always be stored:
- Near to the experiment design and research methodology and research methods, so that the experiment can be easily understood
- In a way such that the information is available as long as the experiment is relevant. It may become apparent that experiment results have greater use beyond the original scope of the study
- Securely, so that the results cannot be lost or modified

### What results are to be stored

Results typically need to be understood within a defined scope, or environment.  Typically researchers will ensure that further recording of the results also include:

- What stage of the experiment the result is related with
- The date and time the experiment stage was conducted
- Where the experiment was conducted
- Variables used by the experiment stage
- The conditions under which the experiment stage was conducted
- What issues were observed during the experiment

### Bias in Results

It is very important that the recording of results is *dispassionate*, and *free of bias*.  Bias in results will prevent the results from being acceptable in the larger scientific community, as it demonstrates an immature research practice.  It is important that when designing the experiment, that sources of bias be identified and where possible eradicated, documented or explained. 

## Assessment of Results

After the results are collected, the results must be assessed as a separate stage.  Assessment can then inform subsequent stages of experimentation.

By assessing the results, we are explaining what the results mean in relation to the experimental stage and the conditions under which the experiment was conducted.

We state:
- What the results mean
- What the results failed to discover

## Conclusions 

As a final step of the experiment, we record:
- What the experiment was, and how it was conducted
- What the experiment was able to uncover
- Whether the hypothesis was validated, or invalidated
- Why the result was successful, or unsuccessful
- Areas of further study which are required
- Recommendations for how to improve the experiment

## Executive Summary

When an experiment is concluded, a document is compiled, containing the research methods used, the hypothesis, results, assessment and conclusion.  At the top of this document, and introduction can be added called an 'Executive Summary', which includes clear, concise detail for a reader of the document what was done, why it was done, and what conclusions were achieved.

## Documentation Format

A simple experiment document would typically include:

- Executive Summary
- Introduction
  - Background
  - Why an experiment is being conducted
  - What an experiment is attempting to discover
  - Quick summaries of earlier experiments which justify the need for the new experiment, and how those earlier experiments relate to the experiment to be undertaken
- Experiment design
  - Objectives
  - Research Methodology
  - Research Methods
- Results *(or how to access results)*
- Assessment of Results
- Conclusions
- References and Bibliography
