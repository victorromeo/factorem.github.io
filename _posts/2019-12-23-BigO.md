Different data structures and algorithms provide varying inherent performance characteristics which will result in a downstream performance outcome on the systems which use them.  

Selection of the best possible data structures and sorting algorithms, will aid fast application performance, by avoiding slow alternatives.

| Type  | Seek _(average / worst)_    | Search                      | Insert                      | Delete       | Complexity   |
|-------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Array | [O(1)][O(1)] / [O(1)][O(1)] | [O(n)][O(n)] / [O(1)][O(1)] | [O(n)][O(n)] / [O(n)][O(n)] | [O(n)][O(n)] | [O(n)][O(n)] |
